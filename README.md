# Gatsby Introduction One

This project contains a blog created to learn Gatsby with React.  The [Front End Masters Gatsby github repository](https://github.com/jlengstorf/frontendmasters-gatsby) by Jason Lengstorf was used as a starter. 

This project covers:
- Using Gatsby, React, and GraphQL to build high-performance websites.
- Loading and pre-fetching assets for subsequent page loads.
- Implementing performance best practices, such as the PRPL pattern, lazy loading assets, and more.
